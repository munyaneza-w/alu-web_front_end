1. ARIAâ€™s Main Purpose
ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) is designed to improve accessibility for web applications by providing extra information to assistive technologies like screen readers. It helps make dynamic content and complex UI controls more accessible by adding roles, states, and properties to HTML elements, thus allowing better interaction for users with disabilities.

2. WCAG Conformance Levels (A, AA, and AAA)
Level A: The minimum level of conformance, which covers the most basic web accessibility features. These guidelines address the most significant barriers for users with disabilities.
Level AA: This level includes all Level A criteria plus additional guidelines to remove substantial barriers for users. Level AA is often the target for organizations aiming for legal compliance.
Level AAA: This is the highest level of accessibility, which makes the web content accessible to the largest possible audience. Achieving Level AAA is ideal but can be impractical for all content types.
3. The Importance of Web Accessibility
Web accessibility ensures that people with disabilities, including visual, auditory, cognitive, or motor impairments, can access and interact with websites effectively. Making the web accessible:

Provides equal access to information and opportunities for all users.
Helps organizations comply with legal obligations.
Improves the user experience for everyone, including older users or users with temporary disabilities.
4. Tools to Use for Web Accessibility
Several tools are available to help ensure websites meet accessibility standards, including:

WAVE: A browser extension that identifies accessibility errors and offers suggestions for improvement.
Lighthouse: A built-in Chrome tool that audits a web page for accessibility and other factors like performance and SEO.
AXE: A developer-friendly tool that identifies accessibility issues in real-time.
NVDA/JAWS: Screen readers used to test how well a website works for visually impaired users.
Color Contrast Analyzers: To check that text is readable against its background color, ensuring proper color contrast.
