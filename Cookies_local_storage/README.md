This project involves multiple tasks related to web storage and cookies using JavaScript. The main tasks involve creating and managing cookies and local storage, including adding, reading, deleting cookies, and implementing a shopping cart with local and session storage.

Here is a breakdown of the tasks:

Task Breakdown:
Basic Cookie Creation:

Set up a basic HTML page with text inputs for firstname and email, and buttons to set and show cookies.
Implement JavaScript functions to set cookies for firstname and email and display them on the page.
Cookie with Expiration:

Modify the code to set cookies with an expiration date of 10 days.
Read Cookie:

Create a function to read cookies by name and display them on the page.
Delete Cookies and Show Form:

Set up a form with login functionality. The page will show a welcome message if the user is logged in or a login form if not.
Implement functions to delete cookies and show/hide the form and welcome message.
Use js-cookie Library:

Replace vanilla JavaScript cookie manipulation with the js-cookie library to simplify cookie operations.
Local Storage:

Create a basic shopping cart using local storage to save cart items across page refreshes.
Implement functions to add items to the cart and display the cart contents using local storage.
Session Storage:

Modify the shopping cart to use session storage, where cart items are cleared when the browser session ends.
Advanced Shopping Cart with Session Storage:

Build a more advanced shopping cart using session storage that can add, remove, and clear items from the cart.
Display cart contents dynamically and allow users to manage their cart.
Requirements:
Editor: Use VSCode or other allowed editors.
JavaScript: Write all JavaScript inside <script> tags in the HTML files.
Web Server: Use webpack-dev-server for serving the pages.
Files: Create multiple .html files (e.g., 0-index.html, 1-index.html) for each task.
Key Libraries:
js-cookie for easier cookie manipulation in later tasks.
Local Storage and Session Storage for managing data across pages.
