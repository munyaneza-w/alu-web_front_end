“Bootstrap Responsive Web Page Project
Introduction
This project is focused on creating a responsive web page using Bootstrap 4.4.1, specifically utilizing the CSS portion of the framework. The main goal is to apply Bootstrap's grid system, components, and utilities to develop a mobile-first, user-friendly design without writing custom CSS. The webpage will adjust its layout based on the screen size, showcasing Bootstrap's powerful responsiveness capabilities.
In this project, no custom CSS is used; instead, all styling is achieved through predefined Bootstrap classes. The webpage contains multiple sections demonstrating how Bootstrap containers, grids, and utilities work to create layouts that adapt across various devices and screen sizes.
By the end of this project, I will have a better understanding of:
How to implement containers for layout control
The usage of the grid system to create structured, responsive designs
How to style with Bootstrap components such as buttons, forms, and typography
The application of Bootstrap utilities for spacing, alignment, and responsive behaviors
This README serves as documentation for the project, explaining its objectives, structure, and the Bootstrap principles applied.”
