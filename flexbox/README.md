Introduction
> The CSS Flexible Box Layout, commonly known as Flexbox, is a powerful layout module designed to help developers create more responsive and dynamic web designs. Unlike older layout methods, such as floats and inline-block, Flexbox provides a simpler and more efficient way to distribute space and align content within a container, regardless of its size. It is especially well-suited for building flexible layouts that need to adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes.
> 
> This project focuses on understanding the core concepts of Flexbox and applying them to create a well-structured, responsive web page. By using Flexbox properties, this project aims to demonstrate how to efficiently align elements both horizontally and vertically, work with the main and cross axes, and understand the difference between flex container and flex items properties.
> 
> Throughout this project, I will explore how to use Flexbox to replace traditional float-based layouts, create a variety of common web design patterns, and utilize Flexbox's powerful tools to make layouts adaptable and user-friendly. By the end, the goal is to gain a thorough understanding of Flexbox and be able to explain its functionality without external references.
